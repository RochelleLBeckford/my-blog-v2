# Practice: Creating a Webpage using the basics of HTML focusing on Semantic HTML Elements

### Practice understanding the Main and Footer of a webpage

-   [ ] Simple practice to gain a better understanding of the purpose of the &lt;main&gt; elelment and &lt;footer&gt; the along with what it entails
    -   [ ] Most sites have a space near the top of the webpage for certain information like a website logo, search bar, the like.
    -   [ ] There is also sections where the main content of the page will reside along with a footer where important information that does not belong in the header will reside.

-   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; element:
    -   [ ] Always goes in the &lt;body&gt; element
    -   [ ] It usually contains a header element: &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
    -   [ ] The &lt;header&gt; elelment is not the same as the &lt;head&gt; element outside of the &lt;body&gt; element

-   [ ] The &lt;nav&gt; element:
    -   [ ] this element tends to containt ordered lists, unordered lists, or even the both types of lists
    -   [ ] These lists typically entails link with the #id-name of the desired section or part of the page would be in the "href" attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element for a list item
        -   [ ] &lt;a href="#about-section"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;
            -   [ ] <a href="#about-section">About</a>
            -   [ ] When the user would click the About link they would then be directed to the About section of the page

  -   [ ] The &lt;main&gt; element:
    -   [ ] This element usually follows the &lt;header&gt; element
    -   [ ] This element contains the main information of the webpage

-   [ ] The &lt;footer&gt; element:
    -   [ ] this element tends to finish off the webpage as it is located at the very bottom of the webpage and last items that will be seen
    -   [ ] For instance:
        -   [ ] A copyright symbol for copyright information
        -   [ ] A link to external sources using the "href" attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element for the links in the list item to external sources
            -   [ ] &lt;a href="/privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
                -   [ ] use the target attribute tp open the link path in a new tab instead of the current page
                -   [ ] <a href="/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy</a>
                -   [ ] When the user would click one of these external links they would be redirected to a new page with the information
