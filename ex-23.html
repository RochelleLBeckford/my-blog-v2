                The header/navigation section of the webpage is not the only
                section of a webpage.
                <br />
                There is a section where the main information of the webpage
                would go.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The element used to do this is &lt;main&gt; within the
                    &lt;body&gt; element
                </li>
                <li>
                    The content inside of the &lt;main&gt; element encompassses
                    the main topics or ideas that will appear on the webpage
                </li>
                <li>
                    There should only be one single &lt;main&gt; element in
                    every webpage
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Once the weboage is populated with all the content that we want,
                the &lt;footer&gt; element is used to finish off the webpage.
                The informaiton in this element usually is beneath the main
                topics of the webpage
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the company/creator</li>
                <li>Some type of copyright information</li>
                <li>
                    Additional links to other sections of the webpage or to
                    other sites
                </li>
            </ul>
        </main>

        <!-- & Footer
        ~ This is where important information will go that it is not suitable for the <header> element
        ~ links to external sources
            ~ in the <a> element -> use href="/privacy" instead of an id to the location of the information on the page href="#privacy"

        <footer>
            <p>
                This section contains important information but it is not
